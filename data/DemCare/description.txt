The ontology has been developed in the framework of the Dem@Care project for representing the experimentation protocol towards diagnostic support and assessment of Dementia in a controlled environment. The aim of the protocol is to provide a brief overview of their health status of the participants during consultation (cognition, behaviours and function), and to correlate the system (sensor) data with the data collected using typical dementia care assessment tools
