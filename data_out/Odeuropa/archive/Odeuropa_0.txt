Which material substances had a role in generating odors for targeted species in a Cultural Heritage context?
During an activity, which actors, associated with a particular nose quality-type, were involved in gestures while experiencing or perceiving odor-based sensory stimuli?
For what animal species and associated with which odorizing-events, an experience of sensory stimuli and consequent evoked odor perceptions occurred within Cultural Heritage settings?
Relate odorizing occurrences to the associated material substances, which acted as carriers, and describe targeted sensory experiences in a Cultural Heritage view.
Which historical instances of odor-generating stimuli and subsequent perceptions, within Cultural Heritage context, had a direct connection to certain animal species?
For certain Gesture-types, which historical actors (E39 Actor), influenced by particular experiences of odors, undertook the activities with a specific nose quality-type (E55 Type)?
Across Cultural Heritage settings, identify odor-focused events, where a targeted species sensed an odor and associated it with a specific Sensory Stimulus.
In the context of Cultural Heritage odors, relate animal species and targeted perceptions of certain Sensory Stimuli, while elucidating odor-generating relationships with material substances.
