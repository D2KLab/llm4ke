Implement a search functionality in the Polifonia ontology using the Elasticsearch search engine. The search functionality should allow users to search for musical pieces based on various criteria such as composer, genre, year of composition, and performer. The search results should display relevant information about the musical pieces, such as title, composer, year of composition, and performer. The search functionality should also allow users to filter the search results based on specific criteria, such as genre or performer. The search results should be presented in a user-friendly and intuitive interface, with clear and concise information about each musical piece. The search functionality should be fast and responsive, with minimal latency and quick response times. The search results should also be accurate and relevant, with a high degree of precision and recall. The search functionality should be integrated seamlessly into the Polifonia ontology, with a consistent and coherent user experience across all devices and platforms. The search functionality should also be scalable and flexible, with the ability to handle large volumes of data and complex queries. The search functionality should also be secure and reliable, with robust data protection and backup mechanisms. The search functionality should also be easy to use and maintain, with clear documentation and support resources. The search functionality should also be customizable and configurable, with the ability to add new criteria and refine the search algorithm. The search functionality should also be accessible and inclusive, with support for multiple languages and accessibility features. The search functionality should also be cost-effective and affordable, with a reasonable price point and transparent pricing model. The search functionality should also be innovative and cutting-edge, with the latest search technologies and techniques
